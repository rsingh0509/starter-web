1. Validate your ownership details on Appraisee Details page & ensure all the details are reflecting correctly. In case the appraiser mapping is incorrect then you can reach out to your current appraiser to initiate the appraiser change request. 
2. Make a note of all the tasks you have done over the assessment year (Jan to June 2020)
3. You can add referral manager i.e. manager other than your appraiser for goals where required
4. You can add supporting documents to your review form like client appreciations etc.
